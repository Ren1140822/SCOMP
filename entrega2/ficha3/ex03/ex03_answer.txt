EX03 : Will these results always be consistent?


R : No, because there is a race condition between both processes, that is when
two or more processes can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time.
In the exercise we try to increment the value, this represents at least three operations (move variable to a register, increment and move back to variable), while both porcesses are doing this concurrently there may be a change they don't 
do these operations in the coorect sequence.

Here is an example how it could go wrong.


PARENT		Value		CHILD
movl eax	100		
		100		movl eax
incl eax	101		
		101		incl eax

movl var	101
		101		movl var
